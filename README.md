### General Recuiting Timeline & More:
Recruiting happens fast, so make sure to submit your applications before all the positions are filled!

| Internship/Co-op During:      | *Most* of Recruiting Happens During: |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Summer 2023      | September-November 2022       |
| Fall 2023   | December 2022-March 2023        |

- 2 main types of interviews for internships/co-ops:
  - Behavioral: Questions in the format of "Tell me about a time when..."
    - Follow the [STAR format](https://careersherpa.net/star-interview-method/) for your answers
    - Search up potential questions or ask the SCS Career Office for a list of potential questions
    - Prepare your answers and practice!
    - This preparation will not only help you format your answers better, but also to give you insights into what you did (weird, right? -- but sometimes you might not realize the impacts that you are creating in things you do on campus/in the classrooms/in labs/etc.). This process will also help with writing personal statements for scholarships/fellowships for now or later!
  - Technical: Questions relating to major-specific knowledge or the role's required technical skills
    - SCS Career Office also has a list of questions for this!
    - Don't fret too much on these! Not everyone remembers everything that they learn. Interviewers are mainly looking at how you analyze the problem and your process of solving that problem!
    
- We **highly** recommend doing a mock interview with the [Career Services Offices](#professional-development-assistance) (bellow this section)

### Company recruiting events

Attend employers' info sessions/events to show your interest and increase your chance of getting an interview! We have created a list of events [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HdGQxLDRX__ig9de2MBqFPoUn4aTHuRzQmy0oCbsq-k/edit?usp=sharing), but feel free to try and find more on your company of interest's website.
